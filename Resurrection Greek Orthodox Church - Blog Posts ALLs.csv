Some notable updates we will be working through July follow:<br><br>On June 14, 2023, the City of Pleasanton approved our Conditional Use Permit (CUP) extension as part of the Planned Use Development (PUD) permit application. This allows us to request construction permits once our designs are finalized.<br><br>Feasibility Study discussions for the continuation of our project capital fundraising effort have largely concluded. We intend to finalize our results and take consultant review comments into consideration, as well as to prepare additional supporting information, in order to recommend a “start date” with the Parish Council in late July.<br><br>We’ve cleared the property of grasses and weeds to meet the abatement requirements of the city. We’ve commissioned a new barbwire fence installation along the entire frontage of the property to ensure its security and expect that to be completed in July.<br><br>As I mentioned in an earlier update, achievement of our collective vision will only be possible with the support and prayers of each one of us. To that end, and on behalf of Fr. Niko, the Parish Council, and all of us who are <em id="""">Building the Body of Christ, let me once again thank you for your support. We encourage everyone to think about the growth of our parish in several ways &nbsp;– physical, spiritual, and communal. Help us build the physical church, participate more in the liturgical life of our parish, and expand your volunteerism and financial giving, both immediate and through trust/estate plans. <br><br>Faithfully, His and your servant,<br></em>George Psefteas<br>Chair, Building the Body of Christ Steering Committee</p><p id="""">&nbsp;<br>‍<br><strong>June 2023 UPDATE<br>‍</strong><br>In January, I laid out our plans for 2023 - work toward site preparation and assess our financial needs. Our hope was to kick-off in the spring of 2023 at earliest, and I am <br>pleased to say we are largely on track. </p><p id="""">We have spent the better part of the last five months working with our consultant, Steve Tibbs and our broader leadership, to assess our capital needs for this initial <br>site-preparation and building stage of our project. That work is nearly complete, and we expect to engage our architects and engineers in the coming weeks and months to authorize the planning and design work required by the utility companies (Pacific Gas &amp; Electric or PG&amp;E) in order to be placed on their calendar for joint trench and utility undergrounding. This effort, which will also include final, design-ready drawings for construction is expected to last approximately two years. There will be very little tangible and outwardly visible work in this stage, but I assure you, these efforts are a necessary precursor to allow us to ultimately “put a shovel in the ground!”<br><br>The Parish Council and BBOC Steering Committee will continue to provide monthly updates, both on the progress of the project and on the progress of the funding campaign to Build the Body of Christ. As I mentioned in an earlier update, achievement of our collective vision will only be possible with the support and prayers of each one of us. To that end, and on behalf of Fr. Niko, the Parish Council, and all of us Building the Body of Christ, let me thank you for your financial support thus far. While we are still near the beginning of our journey, we could not even have come this far without your individual and collective support. Many of our parish leaders, including Fr. Niko and Pres. Stella, Christine and myself, have renewed our financial commitment, and I am pleased to say that the Parish Council recently voted that all Memorial gifts made to the parish be directed to the project. <br><br>In an effort to be even more transparent, <strong id="""">beginning this month we will be listing all of our financial contributors to the Building of the Body of Christ in our monthly magazine</strong><strong id="""">. </strong>This is a living, active, list that will grow because of your love and devotion to your Church and to Christ.<br><br>Faithfully, His and your servant,</p><p id="""">George Psefteas<br>Chair, Building the Body of Christ Steering Committee</p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><p id="""">‍</p>",We laid out our Building Project plans for 2023 - and I am pleased to say we are moving forward!,,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/625a7aaab6cf80112a7cba8e/6476881ed0bcde6e72ab160a_Rendering%203.png,false,,Tue May 30 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),George Psefteas,,Tue May 30 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),,

Our children enjoy being with their grandparents, cousins, and friends, sharing a meal and stories around the table, as we all catch up to see where everyone is in their lives. Many of us take similar trips when we’re able, or welcome family and friends to our homes when they are vacationing themselves, as summer is a time for gatherings and reunions. Visiting beautiful areas is nice, and visiting such places and those near and dear to us makes it an even more enjoyable experience. In the same way in which we enjoy such gatherings, the Lord has expressed His great desire to be with us as well. The Lord says to Jeremiah (32:38-39), <br></p><h4 id="""">“Behold, I will gather them out of all countries… I will bring them back to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely. They shall be My people, and I will be their God.” <em id=""""><br></em></h4><p id="""">God expressed this longing when Israel His people were in exile, and yet everything in the Scriptures is essentially connected to this theme: the Lord gathering His people back to Himself. Jesus expresses this to the Pharisees when he compares God to a mother hen who desires to gather her chicks under her wings! In a very real and vivid way, God delights when we, as His children, visit Him, both in our prayer life and in attending church at our home parish. &nbsp;</p><p id="""">How awesome is His love for mankind, for all of us! Let us always remember that, like any loving parent, the Lord desires to have us dwelling safely in their home, and we can come to church with full assurance of this promise. &nbsp;<br><br>With love in Christ,<br><br></p><p id="""">Father Nikolaos Bekris</p><p id=""""><em id="""">Proistamenos</em></p>","Like any loving parent, the Lord desires to have us dwelling safely in their home, and we can come to church with full assurance of this promise.

She first visited St. James Orthodox Church in Milpitas and got involved with Sunday School and their teen youth group. “I was raised in the Orthodox Church, and I was heavily involved in everything all of my life. I MUST be involved.” While at St. James, friends told her about the Resurrection parish – great sense of community, good for kids, and conveniently close to home, so she decided to “pop in” and check us out.<br><br>Now, Heba loves seeing the JOY children at Resurrection learn about the Faith and come back a week later still referencing the past lesson. Heba credits “the teacher in me . . . with the need to instill the Faith in our kids – everything about the Saints, Liturgy, etc.” (Heba holds a master’s degree in Special Education) And, since she likes to crochet and make arts and crafts in her spare time, our kids benefit from fun lessons and art projects while in her care!

Currently, she calls Livermore home, where she lives with her husband, Mark, and close by, her sister Carol and brother-in-law, Bob Cach. In addition to her husband and sister, Liz has also been blessed with two stepsons, a step daughter-in-law, and an adorable grandson, Asher.</p><p id="""">As a child, Liz thought it would be a glamourous life to be an airline stewardess or an opera star! She sang in several operas (La Boehm) in school, and was inspired by Gian Carlo Menotti’s opera, <em id="""">Amahl and the Night Visitors </em>as a High School senior. Her sister, Kathy (of blessed memory) convinced her to get into music in college and invited her to sing in the Resurrection church choir in the early ‘70s (Kathy was the Choir Director at Resurrection from 1990-2001). When her sister passed away, Liz followed in her footsteps and became Resurrection’s choir director to honor her memory. “I received my calling when Kathy passed away. I felt a sense of duty to the Lord, and as I was driving home and praying about taking on the choir, I received sense of joy in my heart. I heard my sister saying to me, ‘yes, that’s what you need to do!’ I know this is where God – and Kathy – want me to be, and what He wants me to do.” What Liz enjoys most about the music ministry is worshipping and serving God with the members of the choir. “We respect each other’s love for music and serving Christ. We are a great support system for each other.”<br><br>Over time, as Liz developed her taste for conducting, she was asked to help the Church Music Federal Ministry at the Metropolis level. She attended a summer choir conference to learn new liturgical music, and took on the role of Executive Committee Secretary, before serving as Church Music Federal Ministry President from 2014-2018.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type- w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1024px"" data-rt-type="""" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1024px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/625a7aaab6cf80112a7cba8e/62b64fcabbb025a360ab68d0_mml-liz-levy-slide-3.png"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">In her spare time, Liz enjoys watching NCIS reruns, Hallmark movies, and relaxing in her backyard next to her musical and soothing water fountain.

From there, a small group of leaders developed our Parish Vision and Mission, but “skipped” creating the Core Values - until now.<br></em><br>A group of ministry leaders got together in early 2022 to talk about the church mission, vision, and goals for the coming year. As part of that conversation, it was learned that the “what” we wanted to accomplish was clearly defined -but what was missing was the “how.” How we do the work of our Lord is just as important - if not more important - than the work itself. So we embarked on creating our <strong id="""">Core Values</strong>. <br><br><strong id="""">Core Values represent who we are and what’s most important to us. </strong>Core Values communicate how people within the church perform and interact together. They convey our beliefs (who we say God is), guide our identity (who we say we are), our activity (how we do what we do), and how we interact together (teamwork). Core Values are the guiding principles which are foundational to who we are. The guiding principles we came up with are: Belong, Grow, Serve, Act with Integrity, and in all things - Love.&nbsp;When we communicate our core values, it allows others who believe the same thing to participate in the vision for God’s church more quickly. And, it makes decision-making easier. But communicating the values is just step one. In some cases, who we say we are and what we do is aspirational - we may not yet be there. So for us to truly commit to living out our core values, we need to make them part of our “DNA” - our everyday life. To that end, we’ll be highlighting one of the core values in each of our monthly magazines in 2023 with ways our parish council members and ministry leaders are incorporating the values into their meetings and events, along with articles and bible passages that align with our core values. </p><p id="""">Join with us as we devote ourselves to <strong id="""">belong, grow, serve, act with integrity, and love</strong> <strong id="""">one another</strong> this year! </p><p id="""">‍</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""normal"" data-rt-max-width=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/625a7aaab6cf80112a7cba8e/63b6064d0ec0e6aaf71d03a7_Core%20Values.png"" loading=""lazy"" id="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto""></div></figure><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id=""""><br></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">&nbsp;</strong></p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><p id="""">‍</p>","A small group developed our Parish Vision & Mission, but “skipped” creating the Core Values - until now.",,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/625a7aaab6cf80112a7cba8e/63b604c93c8516bac7b950d2_Core%20Values%20Logo.png,true,,Wed Jan 04 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Renee Taylor,,Wed Jan 04 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),,

Veronis</h1><p id="""">How many of us go out of our way to help others? Think about this. Of course, many of us will help others when it’s not too inconvenient. We’ll give a dollar to a homeless person when we pass them by because we won’t even miss that dollar. We’ll put a dollar in the church tray or offer a nominal stewardship donation to the church or some other charity because it makes us feel good, yet we won’t really miss the donation. Yet, I want us to reflect on how many of us&nbsp;<em id="""">go out of our way to help others. <br><br></em></p><p id="""">How many&nbsp;strive to give in a sacrificial manner, giving in a way where it’s a challenge, giving our time, our money, and a part of ourselves when it’s quite inconvenient? </p><p id=""""><br>Do we give when we really feel it, when we have to sacrifice something in order to give? Mother Teresa used to say, <em id="""">“Love until it hurts. I have found the paradox that if you love until it hurts, there will be no more hurt and only love.”<br><br>Think about the time when Jesus and his followers were observing people making donations to the Temple. Who does our Lord praise? The poor woman who offered two copper coins. Her donation was financially insignificant compared to others, and yet Christ noted that her spirit surpassed most others </em>because she gave despite having so little. Her giving was sacrificial. She may have had to deny herself something in order to make that offering.<br><br>God looks at the spirit in which we give; He looks at our generosity in relation to all that He has first given us. Who can outgive God? Ultimately, He is the One who has given us all we have. We are only stewards, caretakers of God’s gifts to us. Will we be good and faithful stewards, generously and sacrificially giving from what He has given us? Will we allow ourselves to be inconvenienced in our giving without getting annoyed? Can we give in a sacrificial manner, giving until it hurts while giving with joy? St. Paul highlights that God loves a cheerful giver. Love until it hurts. <br>‍<br>Give in a sacrificial manner. Inconvenience yourself with compassion and mercy. Jesus loved until it hurt. Christ offered his life in a sacrificial manner. Our Lord revealed divine compassion and mercy, regardless of how inconvenient it is. [Let us]...imitate and cultivate this spirit in our own lives – to help others even when its inconvenient, to give generously of our lives, to love in a sacrificial manner, even to love until it hurts.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><p id="""">‍</p>","How many strive to give in a sacrificial manner, giving in a way where it’s a challenge, giving our time, our money, and a part of ourselves when it’s quite inconvenient?

Monthly Magazine Interview: Meet the Ministry Leader – introducing parishioners to the people behind the ministries.,,,false,,Wed Feb 02 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),David Sherin,"<p>I began attending Resurrection about 3 years ago and was only recently baptized. Coinciding with my journey into Orthodoxy has been my time with our <strong id="""">Feeding the 5,000 Food Pantry</strong>, for which I was recently asked to become co-chair, as Nora Chopelas steps down after 2 years of amazing leadership and service. I’m incredibly humbled and blessed to be given this opportunity.<br><br>As St. Luke recounts, the two disciples who walked with Christ on the road to Emmaus only came to realize who He was when He broke bread with them. So too, do we encounter Christ in the Eucharist when we worship and celebrate the Liturgy. But the life in Christ does not stop here. As He himself says, “For I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in…” (Matthew 25:35) and “And the King will answer and say to them, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to the least of these of My brethren, you did it to Me,'” (Matthew 25:40). I’ve certainly passed the homeless and thought to myself from time to time, what if this man were Christ? But Our Lord’s words remind us that everyone in need is indeed Christ, and in every act of service we encounter Him. In a letter to the Philippians, St. Polycarp writes, “When you can do good defer it not, for almsgiving sets free from death,” here partially quoting from the book of Tobit, and echoing a similar passage from the Wisdom of Jesus ben Sirach. We see here also a consistent theme throughout both Old and New Testament that service to the poor atones for sin. These words of our Lord and His great saints have been a constant encouragement for me during my time volunteering with the food pantry, and I hope to carry that through in my new position.<br><br>During the Pandemic, we saw a doubling of need in the community we serve. God willing, that will drop off as the financial situation of those who come improves, but until then we’ve had an incredible set of volunteers and leaders throughout this time to sustain us and continue this important ministry. It’s always better to have too much help than not enough, so if you have the time, please consider helping! I want to thank everyone who has made, and continues to make, this ministry possible, and I especially want to thank the entire Resurrection community for giving me this opportunity.</p><p id="""">In Christ, <br>David Sherin</p><p>‍</p>",Wed Feb 02 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/625a7aaab6cf80112a7cba8e/62ce0215d58c8602fdf910e2_feeding-5000-digi-sign-.webp; https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/625a7aaab6cf80112a7cba8e/62ce0215993d1541f575e5e6_20220108_085736-002.webp; https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/625a7aaab6cf80112a7cba8e/62ce0215d58c863d27f910e5_david-baptism.jpg

He came to the Bay Area for work but has found that he really loves the sunny California weather and the welcoming Resurrection community. It also helped that he has family in the area (<em id="""">in case you didn’t know, Father Niko Bekris is Niko’s cousin</em>). </p><p id="""">Over the years, Niko has lived between the USA and Greece, where he enjoyed participating with dance groups, festivals, panigiria, and ethima (local holiday traditions). Having attended many international seminars, Niko continues to assist and share these experiences with his students. He has been a participant and award-winning director at FDF for over 20 years.<br><br>We caught up with Niko and found out that he is the middle child in his family, with one sister older and one younger – and all only one year apart in age. You may not know that Niko is also musically inclined, first learning to play piano, bouzouki, and now percussion. A huge sports enthusiast, Niko is on a Soccer team and plays regularly with his fellow Greek team members in San Francisco, along with shooting hoops with the men’s basketball group at Resurrection. In his spare time, you just might find him riding his motorcycle (he owns both dirt and street bikes), snowboarding, or skiing. Niko grew up spending his summers in Greece on his grandparent’s farm, where they grew corn, oranges, and lemons, and raised chickens, ducks, goats, pigs, and sheep. One summer, he and his sisters even had a pet lamb, named Spot who hung out with them in the living room! Niko has always enjoyed being part of the church. He looks up to his parents and was inspired by them and Father Niko at a young age to get involved in the dance groups and to help with the various parish events. As he says, “I’ve been dancing a really long time!” His father taught him that dance is a beautiful expression of the soul – a different form of prayer. He loves to see his students connect to our Greek heritage and Orthodox faith. “Seeing and encouraging the kids to grow into themselves is a beautiful reward.”<br><br>Being involved in all aspects of the church community is important to Niko – helping out at the food bank, attending bible study, going to Greek dance, and church music. To Niko, it’s not just about “being Greek” or “Orthodox,” it’s all of the above. </p><p id=""""><em id="""">To meet or find out more about Niko, look for him at dance practice in the Agape Hall.</em></p><p id="""">‍</p><p>‍</p>",Wed Feb 23 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/625a7aaab6cf80112a7cba8e/62ce010d158249406f4210fd_best-20181215_103835.webp

Her family was active at St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church in San Jose, and that’s where she became involved in the Maids of Athena, GOYA, and Greek Dance – alongside her good friend Vicky Vriheas!</p><p id=""""><br>As a child, Dia dreamed of becoming a teacher. She attended San Jose State but in her junior year of study, she changed her focus to social work. She went on to complete her studies at Sacramento State with a graduate degree in Social Work. Dia is a licensed clinical therapist and is currently working with students at a school in the area. She offers them private therapy and helps foster children with available resources. <br><br>Dia lives in Danville with her husband, Mike and has two grown sons, Peter (San Jose State, Recreational Management), and Alex (University of Reno, Veterinary Medicine). She and Mike met in a Step Aerobics class on an American Air Force Base in Germany where he was stationed…and as they say, the rest is history! Shortly after, they moved to Florida and while there, attended Sts. Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Church. They then spent 12 years in Chandler, Arizona, where Dia was an active social worker – but she dreamed of being closer to her family. Mike challenged her that if she found a job in California they would move. Less than a month later, her sister told her about an opening in the Bay Area, and she landed the job.<br><br>They moved to California in 2012 and it’s been a blessing to be close to family ever since (it also didn’t hurt that they love soccer and are now San Jose Earthquakes season ticket holders)! Once settled in the Bay Area, they visited several churches before coming to Resurrection. At first, they didn’t know anyone in the parish but soon felt right at home when they connected with the Haloulos and Psefteas families.<br><br>Dia has always been involved in the Ladies Philoptochos Society (LPS) to some extent, holding the offices of Secretary twice, and Vice President. So when Kathy Stathis stepped down as President earlier this year, Dia’s bestie, Vicky said “if you run for President, I’ll run for Vice!” Dia loves working with the multi-generational women who make up LPS and who bring so much to the table. And, the social worker in her loves being able to spend money on those who really need it.<br><br>In her spare time, Dia loves to travel, is a history buff and an avid reader of historical fiction. And, you may have seen her on ABC’s American Rescue Dog Show on TV! This coming year, Dia will be working part-time for the school district and starting a teaching position as Professor of Social Work at San Jose State, but her ultimate dream is to buy her father’s birth home in the village of Kiveri, Greece in the Peloponnese and one day retire there.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p>",Which Ministry Leader was seen on ABC’s American Rescue Dog Show on TV?

I consider the Bay Area home, although I add Los Angeles, Amman, Vancouver, and London to the list thanks to work and family. </p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">As a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?</strong></p><p id="""">Coming from a Greco-Arab background, I only had three job prospects – doctor, lawyer, and engineer. I chose the fourth unspoken option – disappointment! Joking! (Although my parents my say otherwise) As a child, I always wanted to be an actor or entertainer in some way, and I am blessed that I’ve been able to make it a reality thanks to God’s will. </p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What brought you to Resurrection?</strong></p><p id="""">Change! My family and I were looking for a supportive, loving, and nourishing parish that truly understood what it means to be an Orthodox Christian and have ministries, events, activities, and educational material to supplement all that…and Resurrection checked all those boxes! Ever since moving here almost 7 years ago, we have been blessed with every minute we’ve been within the walls of this church community. </p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Who/what inspired you to get involved in parish ministry?</strong></p><p id="""">Inspired? I was forced! Joking! Our wonderful Youth Director, Anna, started to get me involved with some of the GOYA events – emceeing the '70s night, starting the Hollywood Meets Orthodoxy Movie Series, etc. before she asked and bestowed upon me the honor of being the Sr. GOYA ministry leader. It was the perfect timing for me because it allowed me to be closer with the church community and give back all the while growing closer to God. </p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What do you enjoy most about your ministry?</strong></p><p id="""">The chance to get to know our GOYAns of the parish and be there for them in case of any trials and tribulations, just as I once was their age and wished I had someone within the church to look up to for help or an extra friend that I could rely on. That and coming up with fun events for them related to the arts 'cause that’s my specialty, baby! </p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What do you like to do in your spare time?</strong></p><p id="""">What spare time? You mean the hours between 2-4AM when I should be asleep but instead am binging the newest streaming series OR writing fervently some new screenplay or musical OR attending late night movie screenings at the local megaplex? Psshh. Spare time. </p><p id="""">&nbsp;</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What would people be surprised to learn about you – any “hidden talents?”</strong></p><p id="""">Iam a polyglot of sorts.

That and I do excellent impressions…waiting 'til Saturday Night Live casts their first Greco-Arab comic.

Truthfully, however, I consider Danville to be home. This is where we lived when we first moved here in 2006 when the kids were 2. Even when we left for three years and lived in Poland, we kept our house and when we came back the kids went to the same elementary school and re-connected with many of the same friends. Who knows what the future may bring but I do feel more at home here now than I do in Vancouver (please don’t tell my mother I said that)!</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What did you want to be when you grew up?</strong></p><p id="""">I wanted to be a cardiologist for as long as I could remember.

When we first moved here, we went to Ascension in Oakland. We had some success meeting people as the kids were young and Christine was able to join the mom/tot group, but it was a big parish, with well-established relationships among long-time parishioners. We met John and Dee Monolakis, who suggested we might like Resurrection as it was a smaller parish. They were absolutely right, and we’ll always be grateful to them for steering us here.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">‍</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Who inspired you to get involved in the parish?</strong></p><p id="""">First, my parents, but unintentionally. While we were a church going family, my parents were never very involved in the programs and ministries of the church, but they did have a strong work ethic and also a kindness and gentleness about them. I have qualities from both, which I believe have served me well in serving the church. Second, my parish priest growing up - Fr. Demetrios Partsafas. As an altar boy, he took an active interest and was a good guide and mentor. As I grew older, he turned to spiritual father and friend. Through his mentorship and guidance, I stayed and served in the altar until my late 20’s, having been tonsured a reader and subdeacon (yes, that’s a thing) and I also got involved leading GOYA. Finally, Christine. We feed off each other - she does so much that she inspires me to do the same. When she sees me involved, she says she’s inspired to do more. It’s a funny circle but if we have to be competitive with each other I’m thinking this is a pretty healthy way to do it.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">‍</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">What do you enjoy most about your ministry?</strong></p><p id="""">It brings me closer to God. I pray more than I used to and I reflect constantly on why I do the things I do. It makes me feel good to see or know that my efforts are furthering the work of the church. Granted, much of my work is administrative and financial but it appears that this is the way God wanted me to use my talents for His glory. Knowing this, and seeing it in action, gives me great enjoyment in doing what I do.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">‍</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">What do you like to do in your spare time?</strong></p><p id="""">Can I laugh now? What spare time?! There is little spare time but when I have it, I want to spend it with Christine and the kids (now young adults).

Currently, she calls Livermore home, where she lives with her husband, Mark, and close by, her sister Carol and brother-in-law, Bob Cach. In addition to her husband and sister, Liz has also been blessed with two stepsons, a step daughter-in-law, and an adorable grandson, Asher.</p><p id="""">As a child, Liz thought it would be a glamourous life to be an airline stewardess or an opera star! She sang in several operas (La Boehm) in school, and was inspired by Gian Carlo Menotti’s opera, <em id="""">Amahl and the Night Visitors </em>as a High School senior. Her sister, Kathy (of blessed memory) convinced her to get into music in college and invited her to sing in the Resurrection church choir in the early ‘70s (Kathy was the Choir Director at Resurrection from 1990-2001). When her sister passed away, Liz followed in her footsteps and became Resurrection’s choir director to honor her memory. “I received my calling when Kathy passed away. I felt a sense of duty to the Lord, and as I was driving home and praying about taking on the choir, I received sense of joy in my heart. I heard my sister saying to me, ‘yes, that’s what you need to do!’ I know this is where God – and Kathy – want me to be, and what He wants me to do.” What Liz enjoys most about the music ministry is worshipping and serving God with the members of the choir. “We respect each other’s love for music and serving Christ. We are a great support system for each other.”<br><br>Over time, as Liz developed her taste for conducting, she was asked to help the Church Music Federal Ministry at the Metropolis level. She attended a summer choir conference to learn new liturgical music, and took on the role of Executive Committee Secretary, before serving as Church Music Federal Ministry President from 2014-2018.</p><p id="""">‍</p>",Wed May 11 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),attachment,

Yet, if we scratch the surface, we will discover profound meanings that speak directly to the way we are to be and to live our Orthodox Christian life.<br><br></p><p id="""">We can start with its dictionary meanings. My Greek-English dictionary uses two words to provide the equivalent of the English word “integrity.” And both of them are highly instructive.<br><br></p><p id="""">In the classical Greek language, the first word is&nbsp;<em id="""">“akeraios”&nbsp;</em>It was used by ancient Greek writers to express meanings such as “pure,” unmixed,” “uncontaminated,” “guileless,” “incorruptible,” “without reservation.” Church Fathers used the word to mean, in addition, “soundness,” simplicity,” and “innocence.”<br><br></p><p id="""">The second Greek word for integrity is&nbsp;<em id="""">“olokleros” </em>pointing in classical Greek to “wholeness,” or “completeness.” Among the Church Fathers, the word came to mean “whole,” “healthy,” and “perfect.”<br><br></p><p id="""">In the New Testament,&nbsp;<em id="""">“akeraios”</em>&nbsp;is used three times. Jesus says, “be . . . innocent as doves” (Matthew 10:16). To the Roman Christians St. Paul writes, “I would have you wise as to what is good and guileless as to what is evil” (Romans 16:19). He instructs the Christians of the Greek city of Philippi to be “blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world.”<br><br></p><p id="""">Also, in the New Testament&nbsp;<em id="""">“olokleros”</em>&nbsp;is used two times. Again, St. Paul writing to the Christian believers in Thessaloniki, prays, “May the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be kept sound and blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Thessalonians 5:23). The Apostle James (<em id="""">Iakovos</em>) exhorts his readers, “Let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing” (James 1:4).</p><p id="""">Integrity is at the heart of Jesus’ teaching in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7). There, Jesus affirms the Old Testament virtues in the Ten Commandments – but insists that the mere external appearance of following them is not good enough. He is concerned that the inner person, with his or her dispositions, motives, and intents be in harmony with the external moral requirements. He is calling us to spiritual and moral integrity. Thus, as James says, “let your yes be yes and your no be no” (James 5:12).<br></p><p id="""">In the wake of the 1990’s business climate of “greed is good” that led corporate executives to trade integrity for deceit, dishonesty, and self-serving greed, the message is clear. Integrity of character is an essential aspect of human being and living. The businessman –and everyone, no matter what his or her occupation - is called to be a person of integrity.<br></p><p id="""">In mathematics, an&nbsp;<em id="""">integer</em>&nbsp;is a whole and complete number. In Christian theology, “salvation” means “wholeness” of our human nature, fulfilling our purpose to be the image and likeness of God. Spiritually, morally, and as individual persons in community, moral and spiritual integrity is essential for being fully and truly human – that is, God-like.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">By Father Stanley Harakas</em></p><p id="""">‍</p>","It isn’t very often that we hear the word “integrity” in the religious language of our Greek Orthodox Church.
